SMART INDIA HACKATHON 2019

This repository contains the backend code for the product prototype we made for the SIH2019's Grand Finale.

Basically our product aims to predict tsunami and alert people, if predicted one.
Also, we plan to help the rescue officials in carrying out the necessary rescue operations through an App+WebPortal.
